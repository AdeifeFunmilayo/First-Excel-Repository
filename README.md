  ![Screenshot (92)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06bc4e55-aa82-4354-b264-a2d1eee370a8)
- Duplicate Check: No duplicate rows were found, ensuring the dataset’s integrity for accurate analysis.
- Missing Values: A thorough check revealed that no missing values were in any of the columns, reinforcing the dataset's reliability.
- Column Removal: Certain columns were removed to focus on essential data for sales revenue analysis:
1. Customer Name: Removed as Customer ID suffices for unique identification.
2. Ship Date: Excluded since it is relevant to delivery insights but not critical for sales revenue analysis.
3. Order ID: Omitted because transaction identification is not essential to the revenue focus.
4. Ship Mode: Excluded as it does not directly impact the analysis of product revenue.
5. Country: Removed since all sales are within the United States.
6. Product Name: Omitted as the Product ID is sufficient for identification purposes.
7. Postal Code: Removed to streamline the dataset further, as it does not contribute directly to sales revenue analysis.
8. Row ID: Removed because it provides a unique identifier but is not essential for analysis.
9. City: Removed, as it is typically not essential for a broad sales analysis unless specific city-level trends are analyzed.
10. State: Removed for the same reason as City; it may not be critical for overall sales analysis.
-New Column Additions:
1. Profit Margin:
   
**Calculation**: A new Profit Margin column was added by multiplying Profit by Sales.

**Purpose:** This metric allows for a deeper understanding of how much profit is generated relative to sales, assisting in profitability analysis.

2. Discount Amount:
   
**Calculation:** A Discount Amount column was created to capture the financial impact of discounts applied, calculated as:
Discount Amount=Sales×Discount

**Purpose:** This metric enables analysis of how discounts affect overall revenue and profit.

3. Discount Range:
   
**Categorization:** A new column was created to categorize discounts into meaningful ranges using the IFS function. The defined ranges are:
(No Discount: 0.0
Low Discount: 0.0 - 0.1
Moderate Discount: 0.1 - 0.2
Discounted: 0.2 - 0.3
Significant Discount: 0.3 - 0.4
High Discount: 0.4 - 0.5
Very High Discount: 0.5 - 0.6
Extreme Discount: 0.6 - 0.7
Maximum Discount: 0.7 - 0.8)

**Purpose:** This categorization enables effective analysis of how different discount levels impact sales and profitability. by using the **ifs** function.
```Excel
=IFS([@Discount]=0,"No Discount",[@Discount]<0.1,"Low discount",[@Discount]<0.2,"Moderate Discount",[@Discount]<0.3,"Discounted",[@Discount]<0.4,"Significant Discount",[@Discount]<0.5,"High Discount",[@Discount]<0.6,"Very High Discount",[@Discount]<0.7,"Extreme Discount",[@Discount]<=0.8,"Maximum Discount")
```
- Final Dataset: After cleaning, the dataset retained 9,995 rows and 14 columns, containing only the most relevant fields for a focused analysis of sales revenue.
